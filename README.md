  Hi, I’m Sergio Figueroa, a recent Cal Poly Pomona business graduate! I majored in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Business Intelligence and I am extremely passionate about data science. It is through my coding (Python, R, SQL, Java), statistics, and business background that enables me to build a story from data that creates a positive and lasting impact for all.
  
  I'm always looking for new opportunities to improve my data science skills and collaborate with like-minded peers. I'm also an avid reader/viewer of food science and coffee content; It's always been a dream of mine to own a cafe somewhere in the world.
